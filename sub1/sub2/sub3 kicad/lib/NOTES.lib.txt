The SMA-EM pads are pulled back 0.67mm from the board edge vs the manuf suggested spec in order to
meet the general PCB pullback requirement of 0.5mm.

The SMA-EM footprint is compatible with using the edge-mount BNC part as an option.

Converting a high-res image to a vectorized .mod:
	Make sure image has empty space along top and left edge for bitmap2component vector bug.
	Use bitmap2component tool to make e.g. oshw.png file -- white area gets silkscreen, black not.
	Use http://escalalibre.com/edwt/kicad_sizeConverter.php to scale to desired mm w/h (retains resolution)
	Use this script with awk to convert .mod file from above from mils to mm:
		awk -f pcb/lib/mil2mm.awk oshw.6mm.in.mod > oshw.6mm.mod
	Remove the first 10 vectors, beginning with "DP 0 0 0 0 10 0.0025 21", which is the bug.
